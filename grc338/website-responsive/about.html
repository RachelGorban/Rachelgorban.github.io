      <h1> About Us</h1>
      <img src="house.jpg" alt="Kerbey Lane Customers">
      <h2>It started with one small house in Central Austin</h2>
      <p>We first opened our doors to the Austin community on May 5, 1980, serving made-from-scratch comfort food out of a small 1930s bungalow in Central Austin on Kerbey Lane.
         For the first few months of business, the original location operated as a restaurant and housed a cozy apartment for our founders, David and Patricia. The beloved original location still stands and thrives today as an iconic Austin landmark.
         Kerbey Lane Cafe remains 100% family-owned to this day and we continue to stay true to our original values of serving delicious meals that are thoughtfully-sourced, scratch-made, and affordable while welcoming all who come through our doors.
      </p>
      <h2>Great food starts with great partners and great ingredients</h2>
      <p>We proudly source food ingredients from local partners and self-sustaining, independent farms who prioritize animal welfare and environmental stewardship.
      </p>
      <h2>It's about more than food - it's about the people
      </h2>
      <p>From one small house to a community of restaurants across Austin, our team helps us grow and improve every single day. We are just as committed to our team as we are to our guests.
         We believe we are a stronger company when our team fully understands our operations. That’s why we’re an open-book company and share financial information with all of our Team Members. We also offer financial and business literacy training and a company-wide profit-sharing plan.
         Above all, we are dedicated to taking care of our team — everyone at Kerbey Lane Cafe is paid above minimum wage and all Team Members are offered health insurance and paid time off.
