                  <p>
                     SPANX founder Sara Blakely was getting ready for a party when she realized she didn’t have the right undergarment to provide a smooth look under white pants.

               <h3>Anser Founder Tia Mowry</h3>
               <p>
                  After enduring severe abdominal pain from her teenage years into adulthood, Tia was diagnosed with endometriosis in 2006. Endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the womb. Far from uncommon, this condition affects more than 6.5 million women in the United States alone, causing debilitating symptoms that include pelvic pain, cramping and infertility.
               </p>
               <p>When she planned to start a family of her own, Tia searched for a treatment that could put an end to her endometriosis. She decided to do a complete diet overhaul by swapping out inflammatory foods like dairy, processed foods, and some of her favorite junk food with healthy greens, fresh fruits, high-quality proteins, and supplements. The result? Life changing improvement to her overall health.

               <p>
                  After a decade of working for large corporations, Victoria Tsai yearned for simplicity and authenticity in her life. Suffering from acute dermatitis and developing a keen awareness of the importance of ingredients on the skin, she began traveling East in search of a more evolved, holistic approach to beauty. On a trip to Kyoto, she discovered a world of pure beauty, craftsmanship and heritage. An encounter with a modern-day geisha changed her life.

               <h3>Why You Should Work For A Woman Run Company</h3>
               <p>
                  Most entrepreneurs pound a long and difficult road, but it's well documented that women have the toughest time. A small library's worth of studies has shown that female founders receive a tiny sliver of the tens of billions in venture capital that are invested each year. What's worse, a depressing number of those who have tried to secure such funding say they were discriminated against. Inc. partnered with our sibling publication, Fast Company, for our first-ever State of Women and Entrepreneurship survey. It reveals that 62 percent of women seeking funding report that they have encountered bias in the process.

               <h3>Why Women Led Companies Are Better For Employees</h3>
               <p>
                  Numerous studies show that women-led companies tend to perform better than those led by men. Even Kevin O’ Leary of Shark Tank fame admits preferring to invest in companies helmed by women because they produce superior returns. Out of more than 40 companies he invested in, about 95% of the women-led companies met their financial targets, compared with just 65% for businesses with male leaders. Not only that, but research conducted by The Harris Poll shows that half of Americans want to work for a female leader. Now, a new survey reveals that women-led organizations are also more likely to have engaged, inspired and satisfied employees than male-led firms. It turns out that companies led by women aren't just good for business; they are also good for employees.

               <h3>Female-led Companies With Billionare Status</h3>
               <p>
                  Unicorns are mythical creatures that captured popular imagination long ago — and even today! In the business world, unicorn companies are an equivalent chimera— they're mythical to start-up founders who dream of joining billion-dollar valuation club. At the moment, there are 357 companies worldwide that have achieved this status (358 if you count Jay-Z as a business, man).
               </p>
               <p>
                  This year has been especially good for a particular segment of the unicorn club: female-led companies. Five women-led U.S.-based tech startups became legendary this year, five more than in the previous three years. Those startups are:
